	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>There are some reasons why I want to become a developer.<br>
	    First of all when I passed my 12th I had no other option<br>
		in my mind and I had no talent or interest, so me and my <br>
		family decided that I will pursue B.tech in CSE.<BR>
		Now, as I decided to pusue B.tech then I need to get a <br>
		job and after doing this degree a person is supposed<br>
		to get a job in tech indrustry but I was unable to get a <br>
		job from my college.So now I am here in Accio Job <br>
		Skill Centre to get a job as I am also supposed to get<br>
		a job in tech field and that's the only reason for me to <br>
		become a Software Developer and yes how can we <br>
		forget that money is an another factor for me :)
